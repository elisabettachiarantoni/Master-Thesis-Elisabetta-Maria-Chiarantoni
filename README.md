# Master Thesis Elisabetta Maria Chiarantoni
This repository contains a set of simulation scripts and analysis files evaluating colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategies implemented in the Canton of Ticino and Fribourg, Switzerland.

**Repository Structure**

This repository contains the following files:

 - File_0_No_Screening
  Simulation of the no-screening scenario.

 - File_1_Ticino
  Simulation of the screening program currently implemented in the Canton of Ticino.

 - File_2_Fribourg
  Simulation of the screening program currently implemented in the Canton of Fribourg.

 - File_3_Clinical_Outcomes_Mortality
  Mortality-focused results from the three simulations (Files 0, 1, and 2), including metrics such as total CRC deaths and reduction in CRC deaths compared to baseline.

 - File_4_Clinical_Outcomes_Incidence
  Incidence-focused results from the three simulations (Files 0, 1, and 2), including metrics such as total CRC incidence and cases prevented relative to no screening.

 - File_5_Combined_Plots
  Plots summarizing and comparing results across the three simulations.

 - File_6_Adherence_Rate
  Sensitivity analysis evaluating the minimum adherence rate required for screening strategies to outperform the baseline.

 - File_7_OWSA
  One-way sensitivity analysis (OWSA) with a Tornado plot.

**Recommended Usage**

It is recommended to store all files in the same directory and execute them in numerical order.
Files that analyze simulation results are independent and can be run individually; however, running them in sequence provides clearer insight into the workflow and overall outcomes of the simulations.
